<p align="center">The best of it all? It has been implemented by WizardsðŸ§™ðŸ§™  (..) oh yes (...)ðŸ§™ðŸ§™ are Real.</p>

###

<p align="left">It aims to allow for user experience resembling the one known from DOS, LINUX, Windows and Mac OS X centralized operating systems.<br><br>We have borrowed from all of these. Yes,  boards a Graphical User Interface. Which is also 100% decentralized. How can a UI be decentralized? Once user connects to a node, it would deliver what we call a Bootloader, which encapsulates IP addresses of other nodes discovered through Kademlia. The Bootloader would then keep fetching assets (code, images,JavaScript modules, whatever) from possibly multiple peers at once, even for a single UI session, while verifying integrity of these. The system, especially the UI is in alpha stage, even still,  it already boards quite a few useful UI dApps (decentralized applications).<br><br> These allow for anonymous web-browsing, file sharing, drag&amp;drop file uploads from native OS, communication, collaboration, end-to-end encrypted group audio / video streaming, multi-party conferencing where you share you screen(s) or particular window(s) from your native operating system, value transfers (both on-the-chain and off-the-chain) and gaming (feeling like looking for some Gold? Launch GridCraft, grab a metal detector and be on your way! It's a game but under the hood it employs some cutting-edge achievements in cryptography to allow for rewards for such miniscule activities as finding stuff within a game).. or you might want to play Snake (also multiplayer!) through the decentralized SSH Terminal Services.. yes.. each node operating the decentralized state-machine is capable of spawning a Shell for you. Most commands are compatible with Unix/Linux and to some extent, with DOS. Decentralized File System supporting Access Control Lists (ACLs) through  SETFACL  GETFACL  commands? Sure! Many in-terminal commands come with built-in MAN-pages.<br>				Maybe you are feeling like deploying a decentralized web-site of your own? Editing it straight within the UI? Be our guest! Maybe you would like to deploy a NFT, by dragging and dropping a file from you computer and setting ownership through CHOWN ? It's all possible. <br><br>As for communication note that we were the first to come up with a data-exchange protocol provably Sybil-proof in any kind of computer networks. All of the communication sub-system employ these research findings. If you use collaboration, communication UI dApps on  , data does not flow throuh any server. No server is involved even during the WebRTC connection establishment phase. It's all decentralized. Definitely feel invited to check out some of our research papers. The only trusted thing from your perspective is your mobile device. Once you install the app (available for both iOS and Android), Hexi (our in-system AI) would guide you through setting up your public/private key pairs. Then, whenever your consent is needed, you would simply scan QR code displayed on screen (it can be rendered in UI session rendered through WebGL, but also in terminal session over SSH through UNICODE 1.1. half-blocks for maximum-terminal data-density).	Remember, it's an alpha stage. We've been implementing it on YouTube LIVE almost each and every day since the early 2017. Private Investments are now open, soon we'll be opening up to a Public Investment Round.</p>

<p align="center"><b>What's In The Repository</b></p>

###

<p align="left">The repository contains source codes of UI dApps currently available on GRIDNET OS. We believe the package to contain superb in-code documentation so it is a great place to get you started. These sample UI dApps take use of all of the sub-systems of GRIDNET OS. Storage, inter-browser communication through Swarms, UI mechanics, communication with the mobile app, invocation of #GridScript core apps residing on the decentralized state-machine, ad-hoc invocation of #GridScript commands, Decentralized Processing Threads, onion routing, user's settings and preferences mechanics etc. We believe the system to allow for any kind of applications you know from platforms such as Windows, Mac OS X and/or Linux.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Learning Curve</b></p>

###

<p align="left">If you know your way around JavaScript, HTML and CSS.. there is almost nothing new to learn. Yeah, really. In most of the cases. GRIDNET OS attempts to hide away all of the aspects of decentralization and make all the components available to you through some nice JavaScript APIs and events. For some advanced programming one may need to use #GridScript which is  largely compatible with Forth.</p>

<p align="center"><b>How to Create an UI dApp</b></p>

###

<p align="left">UI dApps are a mixture of JavaScript, WebGL, CSS, HTML and #GridScript.<br><br>All the synchronization, compartmentation  it is assured by the system. No need to worry about any of the details. Windows, communication, UI mechanics and stuff - it is all taken care of by the system. Shadow DOM Mechanics, WebWorkers, Monitors.. there are all in place assuring proper development and end-user's experience. <br><br>Now, are you willing to deploy an UI dApp of your own? Take a look at 'AppTemplate.js". <br><br>You will quickly find out that it is an ECMA6 class inheriting from CWindow.<br><br>All the sub-systems of GRIDNET OS are available to developers through the CVMContext object.<br><br>You may access it through CVMContext.getInstance() static accessor.<br><br>Each UI dApp has its package identifier ex. "org.gridnetproject.UIdApps.helloWorld"  make sure to change it within the template.</p>

<p align="center"><b>How to Deploy an UI dapp</b></p>

###

<p align="left">Once having at least the Package Identifier changed, simply change extension of the file to *.app and drag and drop it to your state-domain within the â‹®â‹®â‹® File Manager UI dApp and commit. Congratulations! You have just deployed you very first decentralized windowed UI dApp!</p>

###

<p align="center"><b>How to install an UI dApp?</b></p>

###

<p align="left">Simply tap on the already deployed *.app file. The Package Manager has this file-type extension associated. it would automatically kick-in and attempt to parse the package, looking for a default export. The export would be checked for having inherited from CWindow. For testing you need not have committed the package in the first place. Just drag and drop the file onto the File Manager and tap on it to see the package getting installed. On success the icon of your package would appear right on your Desktop. The app's name is derived autonomously from the Package Identifier. Should anything go wrong you would find error messages within the retractable Log Pane. Just make sure event logging for dApps is enabled. For daily use, enabling excessive logging might affect system performance.</p>
